# CTF High Contrast Team Colors
 Made for the Minetest Capture the Flag game. A texture pack that makes it easier to tell the team color of a player.
 
*  To tell which way the player is facing, look for the side of the head where the color is darker (subject to change). 
*  In Classes mode, the outline color is different depending on the class of the player. Knights have a yellow outline, ranged has a pink outline, and support has a green outline.
*  Players without a team have a white skin.
